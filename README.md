# Data Science Intern Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the solutions for the Data Science Internship assignment, which focuses on analyzing an eCommerce Transactions dataset. The assignment includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), a Lookalike Model, and customer segmentation through clustering.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three files:
1. **Customers.csv**  
   - Contains details about customers, including `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `Region`, and `SignupDate`.
2. **Products.csv**  
   - Contains product details such as `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Category`, and `Price`.
3. **Transactions.csv**  
   - Captures transaction records, including `TransactionID`, `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `TransactionDate`, `Quantity`, `Price`, and `TotalValue`.

You can download the datasets using the following links:

## Tasks
### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Perform data analysis to uncover insights from the dataset.
- Deliverables:
  - A Jupyter Notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) containing the code.
  - A PDF report (`EDA.pdf`) with at least 5 business insights.

### 2. **Lookalike Model**
- Build a model to recommend 3 similar customers for a given user based on their profile and transaction history.
- Deliverables:
  - A Jupyter Notebook (`Lookalike.ipynb`) with the model code.
  - A CSV file (`Lookalike.csv`) containing recommendations for customers `C0001` to `C0020`.

### 3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
- Use clustering techniques to group customers based on their profiles and transactions.
- Deliverables:
  - A Jupyter Notebook (`Clustering.ipynb`) with clustering logic and visualizations.
  - A PDF report (`Clustering.pdf`) summarizing clustering results.
